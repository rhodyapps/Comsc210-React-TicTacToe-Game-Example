Updated 2/2024 version of the tic tac toe game tutorial
https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

That said, this repo has separate branches that correspond to each part of the tutorial.
To update this from earlier version:

Run: npm install react-scripts@latest

Update Node: 
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n latest

Add this to package-json dev-dependencies:
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object": "^7.16.7"
 ---------------------

1. clone the repository 
2. npm install
3. npm start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
